spipeRNA version 1.1

What is spipeRNA?
=================

	spipeRNA is a tool for analysis of ncRNAs represented by NGS reads

DEPENDENCIES
	perl
	samtools .. need to be installed and added to your PATH
	bowtie .. executable file included in spipeRNA package, no installation
    required

INSTALL
	Install the required dependencies and execute spipeRNA main script as 
    described in the usage section. For convenience, spipeRNA can be added to 
    your PATH.

USAGE with configuration file
	
spipeRNA -config <file> -i <file> -o <dir>

-config <file>       : Path to configuration file.

-i <file>        	 : Path to pre-processed FASTQ or FASTA file.

-o <dir>             : Path to directory where the output will be stored.
	
OR 

USAGE with input parameters
	
spipeRNA [OPTIONS] -i <file> -o <dir> -index <ebwt> -genome <file> -annotation <file>
	
-i <file>            : Path to pre-processed FASTQ or FASTA file.

-o <dir>			 : Path to directory where the output will be stored.

-index <ebwt>        : Path and basename of the genome index to be searched. 
		               The basename is the name of any of the index files 
                       up to but not including the final 
                       .1.ebwt/.rev.1.ebwt/etc. 
	
-genome <file>       : Path to genome FA or FASTA file. 
	
-annotation <file>   : Path to non coding annotation file. File should contain the
					   following tab seperated elements: chromosome, strand, start loci, 
					   end loci, biotype, transcript id, transcript name.

OPTIONS
   
-t_index <ebwt>      : Path and basename of the transcriptome index to be searched. 
                       The basename is the name of any of the index files 
                       up to but not including the final .1.ebwt/.rev.1.ebwt/etc. 
                       If left blank, spipeRNA will generate transcriptome 
                       index based on the non coding annotation present in provided
                       annotation file and will store that index within the transcripts 
                       directory.
	
-cores <int>         : Number of alignment cores (default: -cores 1).

-collapse <yes/no>	 : Collapse reads with the same genomic sequence. This setting 
					   reduces significantly the execution time. Possible values 
					   yes/no (default: -collapse yes).
	
-m <int>             : Max of multimapping loci, -m in bowtie execution. The mapping algorithm 
                       will be applied only for reads with multi-mapped loci less or equal than m. 
                       Reads with multimapped loci that exceed the -m will be aligned against 
                       transcriptome (default: -m 50).

-mismatches          : Maximun number of mismatches in genomic alignments (default: mismatches=1).
	
-s <yes/no>          : Strand specific mode of the algorithm (default -strand_mode yes).
	
-cd <int>            : Minimum number of unannotated read abundances per cluster (default: -cd 5).
	
-cdi <int>           : Clusters of unannotated reads will be merged if the distance between them 
                       is equal or less than cdi (default: -cdi 50).
